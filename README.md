# Tableau HR Dashboard Project

This project showcases an **HR Dashboard** created using Tableau, built from a flat Excel file as the data source.

## Project Overview

In this project, I transformed and cleaned HR data to prepare it for analysis within the Tableau environment. Using Tableauâ€™s powerful visualization tools, I created an interactive dashboard to help visualize key HR metrics and support data-driven decision making.

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here
